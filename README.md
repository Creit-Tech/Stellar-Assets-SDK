# Stellar Assets SDK

A library to handle all kinds of Stellar assets easily on the Soroban smart contract platform.

### Why making this SDK?

Currently, if you want to get the balance of multiple addresses for multiple assets (something we need to do in for
example xBull Wallet), you will need to either do multiple simulations or getting the ledger keys for each one of them,
and so since we are repeating this over and over across all of our apps, we decided to just make a simple library for
that.

Some people might say "why not using a service for fetching those balances?"... Well, because our wallets are free to
use and open source, we don't make money from them directly and so we need to do stuffs without relying on paying a
third party. Plus we don't think it makes sense to pay for such a basic task as getting a simple balance.

Besides getting balances, we will probably be adding more features to this SDK that are related to using assets.

## Installing the library

Our library is an ESM library (it doesn't support Commonjs projects because Commonjs is a cancer), you can install the
library based on your environment this way:

```text
# Deno
deno add jsr:@creit-tech/stellar-assets-sdk

# NPM and Yarn
npx jsr add @creit-tech/stellar-assets-sdk
npx jsr add @creit-tech/stellar-assets-sdk

# PNPM
pnpm dlx jsr add @creit-tech/stellar-assets-sdk

# Bun
bunx jsr add @creit-tech/stellar-assets-sdk
```

## How to use

Using the library is pretty simple, basically you only need to create a new instance of the `StellarAssetsSdk` class
with an RPC url and you are good to go. You can check all the methods available in the
[docs](https://jsr.io/@creit-tech/stellar-assets-sdk/doc/~/StellarAssetsSdk).

```typescript
import { StellarAssetsSdk } from "@creit-tech/stellar-assets-sdk";

const assetsSDK = new StellarAssetsSdk({ rpcUrl: "RPC_URL" });
const result = await assetsSDK.balance("CONTRACT_ID", "ADDRESS");

console.log(result.balance); // 1550000000n
```

## Classic assets and G accounts

Something you might have noticed while interacting with the RPC, is that if you directly simulate the balance of a
classic asset (for example USDC) you will get an amount the user not always can use, why is that? Well that's because
the user might have offers on the classic side and that will reduce the available spendable balance. For those cases,
this library will give you the real number while also giving you the option to read the full value under the `trustLine`
value returned in the `balance` method's response.
